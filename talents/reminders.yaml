  Multi-stage, escalating reminder system designed for ADHD.
  Not just "remind me at X" but "make sure I actually do X."

  steps:
    - name: "Schedule Intelligently"
      considerations:
        - What's the deadline/appointment time?
        - How much prep time is needed?
        - What's Link's typical schedule?
        - When is he most receptive?
    
    - name: "Multi-Stage Reminders"
      default_sequence:
        - day_before: "Heads up: tomorrow you have X"
        - morning_of: "Today: X at [time]"
        - 2_hours_before: "X coming up in 2 hours"
        - 30_min_before: "Time to prep for X"
        - 10_min_before: "X in 10 minutes!"
    
    - name: "Escalate If Needed"
      triggers:
        - No acknowledgment after reminder
        - Known hyperfocus state
        - High-stakes appointment
      actions:
        - Try different channel
        - More urgent language
        - Involve Skippy for interrupt
    
    - name: "Respect Boundaries"
      rules:
        - No reminders during sleep hours (11pm-7am)
        - Batch non-urgent reminders
        - Don't interrupt deep work for minor stuff
    
    - name: "Learn Patterns"
      track:
        - Which reminders get acknowledged?
        - What timing works best?
        - What language cuts through?

proficiency_matrix:
  skippy-haiku: proficient (simple reminders)
  skippy-sonnet: proficient
  skippy-opus: proficient
  bilby: aware
  nagatha: master

tools_used:
  - cron (scheduled jobs)
  - message (notifications)
  - memory (tracking patterns)

notes: |
  Nagatha owns reminders but can spawn Haiku sub-agents
  for the actual notification delivery. The intelligence
  is in the scheduling and escalation logic.
