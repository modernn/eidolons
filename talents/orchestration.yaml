  The meta-talent of routing requests to the right agent and resolution.
  This is what makes the collective work as a unified system.

    - name: "Analyze Request Complexity"
      actions:
        - Check keywords (quick, detailed, comprehensive, analyze)
        - Count required steps
        - Detect emotional/family content
        - Assess system complexity
    
    - name: "Consider Context"
      actions:
        - What's Link's current state? (busy, relaxed, stressed)
        - Is this urgent?
        - Who handled similar requests before?
        - What's the conversation history?

      actions:

  Skippy is the primary orchestrator. Bilby and Nagatha may route
  to each other for cross-domain tasks, but Skippy usually handles
  the initial routing decision.
