description: |
  The ability to model how family members think, feel, and might
  respond to situations. Used for conversation prep, conflict
  navigation, and building empathy.

data_sources:
  - family_soul_files: "~/.moltbot/family/*.soul.md"
  - conversation_history: "Prior discussions with Link"
  - explicit_input: "What Link shares directly"

creative_method:
  steps:
    - name: "Load Family Context"
      actions:
        - Read relevant .soul.md file
        - Review values, triggers, communication style
        - Note current life context
    
    - name: "Simulate Perspective"
      prompt: "If I were [person], how would I feel about X?"
      consider:
        - Their core values
        - Their likely concerns
        - Their history with Link
        - Their communication style
    
    - name: "Generate Insight"
      outputs:
        - "She'll likely worry about..."
        - "His real concern is probably..."
        - "Best approach: acknowledge X first"
    
    - name: "Suggest Strategy"
      elements:
        - timing: "When to bring it up"
        - framing: "How to say it"
        - preparation: "What to have ready"
        - pitfalls: "What to avoid"
    
    - name: "Iterate Based on Reality"
      actions:
        - After conversation: "How did it go?"
        - Compare prediction to reality
        - Update model if wrong
        - Note what worked/didn't

ethical_guardrails:
  - "This is a model, not mind-reading"
  - "Purpose is empathy, not manipulation"
  - "Always verify with actual conversation"
  - "Update when predictions are wrong"
  - "Never share files with family members"

proficiency_matrix:
  skippy-haiku: delegate
  skippy-sonnet: capable
  skippy-opus: master
  bilby: aware
  nagatha: proficient (opus mode: master)

notes: |
  This talent requires depth and nuance. Haiku can't do it.
  Sonnet can do surface-level ("Kayla values family time").
  Opus is needed for real perspective modeling.
